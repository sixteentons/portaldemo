## 16-T Static Site (Updated: 11-21-2017)

- This README functions as site index for now.

- Use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sixteentons/portaldemo/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

- Whenever you make a new commit, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) rebuilds the site pages from the content in your Markdown files.
